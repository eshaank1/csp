    "Bandwidth:\n",
    "1. In the context of computer networks, elaborate on the concept of bandwidth. Discuss how bandwidth influences the speed and efficiency of data transfer. Provide examples of scenarios where both high and low bandwidth can impact the performance of internet connected devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandwidth is the max amount of data that can be sent to a computer network, it shows the strength of the network as it is how much data it can handle.  Bandwith influences the speed/efficiency of the data transfer as higher bandwith can handle higher amounts of data and therefore make the data transfer more efficient and fast.  An example of this is when playing video games it is better to use ethernet becuase it has a higher bandwith and handles more data and in turn makes the game run faster and smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Network:\n",
    "2. Explore computer networks by detailing the key components and their interplay. Discuss the significance of scalability, security, and reliability in designing computer networks. Provide real-world examples of how different types of computer networks, such as local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs), serve distinct purposes in various settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components are nodes, network interface cards, switches, routiers, cables, and wireless access ports.  These all connect together to transport data.  Scalability, security, and reliability is all very important when designing computer networks becuase you need a reliable network that is up, it needs to be scalable so you can make it bigger if needed, and it needs to be secure so nobody can steal your info.  LANs are used in smaller situations like home or school wifi and connect the people in this small area to the same wifi, and it is safer because it is smaller in size.  WAN is less safe becuase it is very large and an example of WAN is the internet, which connects people globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packet Switching:\n",
    "3. Investigate packet switching and its role in modern communication systems. Compare and contrast packet switching with alternative methods, such as circuit switching, highlighting the advantages that packet switching brings to data transmission. Describe the journey of a data packet through a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packet switching is a way of grouping data that is sent over networks into packets.  It has a large role in modern systems as data we send is made into packets then unpacked on the recieving end.  Circuit switching is an older method where a specific path is established between 2 areas of a network for their communication, it is exclusive but open.  Packet switching brings an advantage as it is more efficient and less resources are used by the network.  The journey a data packet takes through a network is it starts at the source, becomes a packet, is sent to the network which routes it toward its destination, then is unpacked into its original data.  An example of this would be an email as it travels from sender to reciever through networks."
