    "- Procedures are used to create algorthims that can perform certain actions or return values\n",
    "- Functions and classes take parameters and organize code\n",
    "- Object Oriented Programming is an important skill to organizing code among different files\n",
    "- Libraries can be used to import functions from pre-made libraries, famous ones include PIL images, turtle, and others\n",
    "- Simulations are used to mimic real life events\n",
    "- Simulations allow us to draw accurate inferences from real life simulations and gain insight\n",
    "- Common simulations use cases are like rolling a dice or flipping a coin\n",
