    "## Student-Developed Procedure Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the Procedureâ€™s Name, Return Type, and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement Met:** The function ```fetchCryptoData``` is a student-developed function that fulfills the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Procedure Name:** ```fetchCryptoData```\n",
    "- **Return Type:** ```void``` as the function does not explicitly return any value, but it performs asynchronous operations and updates the UI with a success/error message\n",
    "- **Parameters:** No direct parameters, but the function relies on the value of an input field with the id ```cryptoSymbol``` to determine the symbol of the cryptocurrency to fetch data for, which is a user-provided parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchCryptoData() {\n",
    "    const symbol = document.getElementById('cryptoSymbol').value;\n",
    "    console.log(`Fetching data for symbol: ${symbol}`);\n",
    "            \n",
    "    const response = await fetch(`https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY&symbol=${symbol}&market=USD&apikey=REDACTED`);\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (response.ok) {\n",
    "        const data = await response.json();\n",
    "        displayCryptoData(data);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        console.error('Failed to fetch cryptocurrency data.');\n",
    "        document.getElementById('cryptoData').innerHTML = 'Failed to fetch cryptocurrency data.';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implements an Algorithm with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement Met:** Within the function ```fetchCryptoData``` a student-developed algorithm exists which satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequencing:** The function sequentially retrieves the cryptocurrency symbol from the UI input, stores this as a variable, asynchronously sends a request to the Alpha Vantage API with the symbol taken from the variable, and recieves/processes the response data from the backend, either displaying the data or handling/displaying errors.\n",
    "- **Selection:** The function uses a conditional statement to check if the response for the API is successful (```response.ok```).  If it is, the function proceeds to extract and display the fetched data.  Otherwise, the function logs an error message and updates the UI output to show a failure in fetching the data.\n",
    "- **Iteration:** There's no explicit iteration in the function currently as it is designed to handle a single request for cryptocurrency data based on user input. However, this is an easy fix as it could be extended to support iteration if needed, such as fetching data for multiple cryptocurrencies in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchCryptoData() {\n",
    "    const symbol = document.getElementById('cryptoSymbol').value;\n",
    "    console.log(`Fetching data for symbol: ${symbol}`);\n",
    "            \n",
    "    const response = await fetch(`https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY&symbol=${symbol}&market=USD&apikey=REDACTED`);\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (response.ok) {\n",
    "        const data = await response.json();\n",
    "        displayCryptoData(data);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        console.error('Failed to fetch cryptocurrency data.');\n",
    "        document.getElementById('cryptoData').innerHTML = 'Failed to fetch cryptocurrency data.';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure Call in the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement Met:** The function ```fetchCryptoData``` is called in the program as a button immediately after it is defined, ensuring that it is used after the user input.  This demonstrates the integration of the student-developed procedure into the program, fulfilling its purpose of fetching and displaying crypto data upon initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<button onclick=\"fetchCryptoData()\">Fetch Crypto Data</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## List Management Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Data in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement Met:** The following code demonstrated data is being storred in a list/array after it is fetched from the backend.  The array (data) manages complex data structures by organizing the fetched crypto information into a iterable and readable format for the user output.  The program would not be able to run without this list as it stores all the data that is displayed to the user in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const response = await fetch(`https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY&symbol=${symbol}&market=USD&apikey=REDACTED`);\n",
    "const data = await response.json();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilizing List Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement Met:** The function ```fetchCryptoData``` retrieves cryptocurrency data from an API based on user input, represented by the symbol obtained from an HTML input field. While it does not explicitly utilize list data, it indirectly interacts with list data through the response obtained from the Alpha Vantage API (stored in ```response```). The API response contains cryptocurrency data organized in lists/arrays, which is then processed further by the ```displayCryptoData``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchCryptoData() {\n",
    "    const symbol = document.getElementById('cryptoSymbol').value;\n",
    "    console.log(`Fetching data for symbol: ${symbol}`);\n",
    "            \n",
    "    const response = await fetch(`https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY&symbol=${symbol}&market=USD&apikey=REDACTED`);\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (response.ok) {\n",
    "        const data = await response.json();\n",
    "        displayCryptoData(data);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        console.error('Failed to fetch cryptocurrency data.');\n",
    "        document.getElementById('cryptoData').innerHTML = 'Failed to fetch cryptocurrency data.';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function displayCryptoData(data) {\n",
    "    if (!data['Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)']) {\n",
    "        document.getElementById('cryptoData').innerHTML = 'No data available for this symbol.';\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    const timeSeries = data['Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)'];\n",
    "    const latestDate = Object.keys(timeSeries)[0];\n",
    "    const latestData = timeSeries[latestDate];\n",
    "\n",
    "    const content = `\n",
    "        <p>Date: ${latestDate}</p>\n",
    "        <p>Open: ${latestData['1a. open (USD)']}</p>\n",
    "        <p>High: ${latestData['2a. high (USD)']}</p>\n",

    "## Purpose of Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool to find prices and latest info on cryptocurrencies.  The user simply inputs a crypto symbol into the input box, clicks the \"Fetch Crypto Data\" button which runs the processes described above, and recieves an output with the latest data on the requested cryptocurrency, including prices at the open, close, high, low, and volume of crypto sold.  There is also a useful \"Info\" section on the webpage that allows users to interpret the output and understand what they are seeing.\n",

    "This was the commit where I committed the API url and key to my backend repository.  The whole project and feature was based off this API and this commit, and it was very important because it came after hours of research for the best fitting API for my project and my feature.\n",
